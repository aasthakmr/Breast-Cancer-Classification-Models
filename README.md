# Breast Cancer Classification (Recall-Focused)

This project compares three machine learning modelsâ€”**Decision Tree**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, and **Logistic Regression**â€”on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. The emphasis is on **maximizing recall** to reduce false negatives, which is critical in medical diagnosis.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Insights
- **Decision Tree:** Overfits after depth â‰¥ 4, failing to generalize malignant cases effectively.  
- **KNN:** Optimal performance at `k=4â€“6`, balancing recall and generalization.  
- **Logistic Regression (L1):** Achieved **99% recall** for malignant tumors (no false negatives), outperforming other models.
